attempt to make an Doctor Appointment ios app using UIKit

I was practicing on implementing
- MVVMC design pattern "Model View ViewModel Controller"
- Coordinator design pattern
- Firebase integration "Email and Google Auth"
- Core Animation "Animating UITabBar"
</br>
during this challenge, I made a Pull Request to the well-known swift package with 7.1k stars "ViewAnimator", now it supports the animation of a series of keyframes

I hope you explore all of this and your feedback will be appreciated
